## How It Works

### Fetching Data:
The **JavaScript** file uses the **Binance API** to fetch real-time data for cryptocurrency prices, volume, and other relevant statistics.

### Sorting and Displaying Coins:
The **Binance API** returns data for all cryptocurrency pairs, but only the top 50 coins are selected based on trading volume. These selected coins are displayed in a card format.

### Real-Time Updates:
The prices, 24-hour change percentage, high, low, and volume values are updated every 10 seconds, ensuring real-time market information.

### Responsive Design:
The layout adapts to different screen sizes using **CSS Grid** and **Media Queries**, making the dashboard mobile-friendly.
